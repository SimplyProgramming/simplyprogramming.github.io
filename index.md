### Ordered list

1. Item 1

4. ?

*Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for [Roman numeral four][2].*

### Unordered list

## Paragraph modifiers

### Code block

  Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text.

You can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.

### Quote

> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.

## Headings

There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page.

### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**

### They can even contain `inline code`

Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.

I don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here.
